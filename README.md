WebDAV (*Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning*) is an extension of
the HTTP protocol that allows users to collaboratively edit and manage
files stored on remote web servers. It provides a framework for users to
create, delete, copy, move, and download files.

### Examples of WebDAV Servers

Some platforms that implement WebDAV are:

1.  **OwnCloud**: A popular open-source platform for storing and sharing
    files, commonly used by organizations.
2.  **NextCloud**: A fork of OwnCloud that focuses on user-friendly
    interfaces and collaborative file-sharing features.
3.  **mod_dav** for Apache HTTP servers: Adds WebDAV support to the
    Apache web server.
4.  **Microsoft SharePoint**: Uses WebDAV for file management over the
    web.
